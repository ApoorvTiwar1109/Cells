        <p>Cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life. The human body is composed of trillions of cells. They provide structure for the body, take in nutrients from food, convert those nutrients into energy, and carry out specialized functions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While examining a thin slice of cork, Robert Hooke saw that the <a href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589562760889-38898c71d3d8?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=436&q=80" target="_blank">cork</a> resembled the structure of a honeycomb consisting of many little compartments. This was in the year 1665 when Hooke made this chance observation through a self-designed microscope. Robert Hooke called these boxes cells. Cell is a Latin word for ‘a little room’.</p>

        <h3 id="structure">Basic Cell Structure</h3>
        <p id="basic"> Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristic of all living forms. How does a living  cell perform these basic functions? Different parts of the human body perform different functions. The human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. In fact, each such cell has got certain specific components within it known as cell organelles. Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material from the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and perform all its functions because of these organelles. These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the cell. It is interesting that all cells are found to have the same organelles, no matter what their function is or what organism they are found in.</p>

        <p id="unimulti">&nbsp;&nbsp;All organisms that we observe around are made up of cells. However, there are also single cells that live on their own. A single cell may constitute a whole organism as in <a href="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8bd7f09734b7e57599e224e128b55859-pjlq" target="_blank">Amoeba, Chlamydomonas, Paramoecium and Euglena</a>. These organisms are called unicellular organisms (uni = single). On the other hand, many cells group together in a single body and assume different functions in it to form various body parts in multicellular organisms (multi = many) such as some <a href="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/blue-mould-covers-slice-of-very-stale-bread-picture-id614876142?s=612x612" target="_blank">fungi</a>, plants and animals.</p>

        <h3 id="cellmembrane">Cell Membrane</h3>
        <p id="cm">This is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. The cell membrane or plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane.</p>
        <p id="osmosis">&nbsp;&nbsp;Substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion.In this process, there is spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low. For example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell. As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process of diffusion.</p>
        <img src="C:\Users\Smriti Tiwari\Desktop\img\t.png" alt="Oops! Try Again" width="" height="">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high water concentration through a selectively permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration till equilibrium is reached. There can be 3 different types of solutions in Osmosis - </p><br>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis.</li>
            <li>If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution.</li>
            <li>If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="cytoplasm">Cytoplasm</h3>
        <p>When we look at the temporary mounts of onion peel as well as human cheek cells, we can see a large region of each cell enclosed by the cell membrane. This region takes up very little stain. It is called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane. It also contains many specialised <a href="https://www.microscopemaster.com/images/largerimageAnimal_Cell_and_Components.jpg" target="_blank">cell organelles</a>. Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the cell.</p>
        <img src="C:\Users\Smriti Tiwari\Desktop\img\0.jpg" alt="Oops! Try Again">
        <h3 id="nucleus">Nucleus</h3>
        <p>The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm. Nucleus is called the control-centre of the cell as it takes all the decision, basically like a brain. The nucleolus is the largest structure present in the neucloplasm. It is best known as the site of ribosome biogenesis. Nucleolus also participate in the formation of signal recognition particles and play a role in the cell's response to stress.The annulus is a sturdy tire-like structure that encases a gel-like center, the nucleus pulposus. The annulus enhances the spine's rotational stability and helps to resist compressive stress.</p>
        <img src="C:\Users\Smriti Tiwari\Desktop\img\n.png" alt="Oops! Try Again">
        <p id="chromo">&nbsp;&nbsp;The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes.</p>
        <p id="pe">&nbsp;&nbsp;In some organisms like <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/08/44/77/084477b9ec96dd5e0ea6102f6c8e2d71.jpg" target="_blank">bacteria</a>(unicellular organism), the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nucleic+acid&oq=nucleic+&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l3j0i433i512l2j0i512l4.4668j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">nucleic acids</a> is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.Prokaryotic cells also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles present in eukaryotic cells. Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly organised parts of the cytoplasm.</p>

        <h3 id="cellwall">Cell Wall</h3>
        <p>Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/O5DYhQ9NdJGVJp7HuE13HIBNilI=/774x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/cellulose-in-plants-dda06ace9366448f9010cbad8b96028c.jpg" target="_blank">cellulose</a>. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cell.</p>
